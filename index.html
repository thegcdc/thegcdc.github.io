This includes software, data, artificial intelligences and robots. One way to achieve this goal is through the creation, growth and protection of our digital commons.</p>

How can we bring those models about? <br><br>Digital Commoners aims to bring together practioners, technologists, legal professionals and academics working on this problem, as well as the many communities seeking to gain control over digital resources (including data).</p>

              <p class="">This event, organised together with the Aapti Institute, will bring together practitioners, researchers, academics, and other experts working on models to harness the value of data with the aim of redistributing power in the digital economy. The purpose of these discussions is to explore the different decisions, structures, technological choices and the lessons we as a community can draw from them.</p>

             <div class="sm-col sm-col-6 px3 py0">
              <p class="">The aim of these conversations is to move data stewardship out of the theoretical realm into reality. The Data Governance Deep Dives are intimate and informal discussions to learn about the realities of alternative models of data governance, and what it takes to put power back in the hands of people. </p>
