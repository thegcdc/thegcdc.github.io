              <p class="">We believe that the digital infrastructures that we rely on for our every day lives should be build for us all and with us all. This includes software, data, artificial intelligences and robots. One way to achieve this goal is through the creation, growth and protection of our digital commons. <br><br>What governance models, rights and infrastructures do we need to democratically govern the digital commons at relevant scales? How can we bring those models about?</p>

              <p class="">Digital Commoners aims to bring together practioners, technologists, legal professionals and academics working on this problem, as well as the many communities seeking to gain control over digital resources (including data). <br><br>Through events, conversations and knowledge sharing we hope to foster collaborations between these overlapping group, as we together learn to create and adopt alternative models to govern digital infrastructures.</p>

             <p>This event, organised together with the Aapti Institute, will bring together practitioners, researchers, academics, and other experts working on models to harness the value of data with the aim of redistributing power in the digital economy. The purpose of these discussions is to explore the different decisions, structures, technological choices and the lessons we as a community can draw from them. We hope these conversations can help move data stewardship out of the theoretical realm into reality, and examine its impact on communities and more broadly the data economy. </p> <p>The Data Governance Deep Dives are intimate and informal discussions, which aim to uncover the realities of alternative models of data governance, and what it takes to give power and decision-making back in the hands of the people. </p>
